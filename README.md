# Team-Shaky
# Tic-Tac-Toe Al model
We are bulding a 3D tic-tac-toe model in 3 phase. This will be a Windows 10 game based on the hand gesture.

# Phase-1:
1. In this phase we are going to use the concept of Minimax Algorithm.
2. In minimax, We are trying out all the moves and figuring out which one is most optimal, which is also know as utility function.
3. Which is basically a measurement that how valuable the final result in that tree is.

# How to run phase-1:
 To run this part you can use pycharm, googlecollab,etc..
